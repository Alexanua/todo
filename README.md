# Project name
## Todo APP

# Description
- This project is a Todo app designed to help users write and organize their tasks. The app allows users to create, update,
and delete tasks, mark tasks as completed, and categorize tasks into different .

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

# What was your motivation?
- The motivation behind this project was to enhance my skills in developing applications using Java and working with databases. I wanted to create a practical application that would help users stay organized and manage their tasks effectively. Additionally, 
- I wanted to gain experience in writing unit tests and using mockito to simulate interactions with a database.

# What problem does it solve?
- This Todo app aims to solve the problem of task management and organization. 
Many people struggle to keep track of their tasks and often forget important deadlines or fail to prioritize their work effectively. By providing a simple and intuitive interface for creating and managing tasks, 
this app helps users stay organized, improve productivity, and ensure that important tasks are not overlooked.

# What did you learn?
- During the development of this project, I learned several 
valuable lessons. Firstly, I gained experience in working with the SQLite database and 
learned how to perform basic database operations such as inserting, updating, and retrieving data. 
I also learned how to write unit tests using JUnit and Mockito to ensure the correctness of my code and simulate interactions with the database. Additionally, I enhanced my understanding of software design principles and best practices, such as separating concerns and maintaining code modularity.
